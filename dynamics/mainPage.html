                    <p class="content">Classical mechanics offers two distinct ways to understand the motion of objects. The first views mechanics as a theory of forces , focusing on the causes that drive motion. The second sees it as a theory of motions themselves , emphasizing the paths objects naturally take. These perspectives align with Newtonian Mechanics  and Lagrangian Mechanics , each offering unique insi. <span class="read-more"><a class="read-more-link" href="../dynamics/blogPosts/week1.html">...Read More</a></span>
